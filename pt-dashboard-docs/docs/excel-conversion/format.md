So for the stok alat and rekapan stuff and their dates format

We set all dates in the stok alat to be in DD/MM/YYY format

For the rekapan excel file names. We store them in YYYY-MM-DD format because that's just what mom wnats and is used to

So sending and retrieval of rekapan by dates is done by yyyy-mm-dd but the record rows for everything use dd/mm/yyyy because it's just friendlier
